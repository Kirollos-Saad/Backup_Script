# Backup Script README

## Overview

This is a simple Bash backup script designed to automatically back up a directory to a specified destination. The script monitors changes in the source directory and creates backups at regular intervals or when changes are detected.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Bash**: The script is written in Bash, which is available by default on most Unix-like systems.

2. **Linux or Unix-like System**: The script is primarily intended for use on Linux or Unix-like operating systems.

3. **Make**: If you plan to use the provided Makefile for automation, ensure that the `make` utility is installed.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and use the backup script:

1. Download or copy the script to your desired directory.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Make the script executable by running the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x backup.sh

## Run

cd to the directory where the "Makefile" is available then type:
make
